PARallelMUltifurcatingGIbbsTrees - Hierarchical structure in relational data

In this project, carried out at Technical University of Denmark, we implemented a hierarchical relational model in the style of [Schmidt et. al.][1], but with a Bernoulli-likelihood (and appropriate Beta-priors). 

All of the implementation was done in C++.
